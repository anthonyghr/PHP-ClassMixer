PHP ClassMixer is a small, but powerful utility to enable the use of multiple inheritance
and a form of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in PHP.
It grew out of a sense of frustration with some of the limitations imposed by the PHP language,
and a desire to more closely adhere to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) software 
engineering principle. 
ClassMixer has allowed Wellspring engineers to significantly decrease code duplication
throughout our codebase by encapsulating repeated patterns found in several of our classes 
into reusable mixins, reducing the lines of code in many of our classes by over 50%.

As its name implies, ClassMixer is a utility that 'mixes' a set of 'parent' classes, resulting in
a 'child' class that has all the attributes and methods of the parents. In addition, ClassMixer
provides the ability to create 'before' and 'after' methods. These methods are similar to
pointcuts in AOP, allowing the interjection of code at the beginning (before) or the end (after)
of a method execution.

Installation
============
Installing ClassMixer is trivial. Simply copy the ClassMixer.php file to the directory of your choice,
and include/require it.

Requirements
============
To make use of the complete feature set of ClassMixer, PHP 5.0 or above must be installed on the system.
However, ClassMixer is still functional with a limited set of features using PHP 4.2 or above.
